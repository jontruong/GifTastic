# GifTastic

In this repo the goal was to create a dynamic web page that populates the page with Gifs of the user's choice. 

To do this I used an Ajax call to the Giphy Api. 

First I took took the user's input and made a button. Then made it so that when the user clicked that button 10 gifs would appear along with the rating.
